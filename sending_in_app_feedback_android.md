# Capture and send in-app user feedback
{: #sending_in_app_user_feedback_android}

In-App User Feedback deepens your application performance analysis. You can enable your application users and testers to provide rich contextual feedback to the app owners. App owners get real-time feedback from its users on the application usage experience, which App owners and Developers can further act on. This feature brings in significant agility to application up-keep. Use the following API to switch your application to Interactive Feedback Mode in any action handler in your application, for example, when you handle the click of a button or the selection of a menu item.

To enable your android app to send in-app user feedback, perform the following steps.

1. Add the following dependency into your applicationâ€™s Gradle script.

   ```bash
   compile 'com.ibm.mobile.foundation:ibmmobilefirstplatformfoundationanalytics:8.0.+@aar'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. In your Android application, use the following Java API method in the action handler.

   ```java
   WLAnalytics.triggerFeedbackMode();
   ```
   {: codeblock}
