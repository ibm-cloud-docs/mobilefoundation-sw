# {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}
{: #push_notifications}

Notifications are the ability of a mobile device to receive messages that are "pushed" from a server. Notifications are received regardless of whether the application is running in the foreground or background.  
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} provides a unified set of API methods to send push notifications to iOS, Android, Windows 8.1 Universal, Windows 10 UWP, and Cordova (iOS, Android) applications. 
Attribution: Microsoft, Windows, Windows NT, and the Windows logo are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both.
The notifications are sent from the {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_short_notm}} to the vendor (Apple, Google, Microsoft, SMS Gateways) infrastructure, and from there to the relevant devices. The unified notification mechanism makes the entire process of communicating with the users and devices transparent to the developer.

## Device support
{: #device-support}

{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} is supported for the following platforms in {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}:

* iOS 8.x or later
* Android 4.x or later
* Windows 8.1, Windows 10

><cite>Microsoft, Windows, Windows NT, and the Windows logo are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both.</cite>

## Push notification forms
{: #push-notifications-forms}

Notifications can take several forms:

* **Alert** (iOS, Android, Windows) - a pop-up text message.
* **Sound** (iOS, Android, Windows) - a sound file playing when a notification is received.
* **Badge** (iOS), Tile (Windows) - a graphical representation that allows a short text or image.
* **Banner** (iOS), Toast (Windows) - a disappearing pop-up text message in the device display.
* **Interactive** (iOS 8 and higher) - action buttons inside the banner of a received notification.
* **Silent** (iOS 8 and higher) - sending notifications without disturbing the user.

## Push notification types
{: #push-notification-types }

### Tag notifications
{: #tag-notifications-overview}

Tag notifications are notification messages that are targeted to all the devices that are subscribed to a particular tag.  

Tags-based notifications allow segmentation of notifications based on subject areas or topics. Notification recipients can choose to receive notifications only if it is about a subject or topic that is of interest. Therefore, tags-based notification provides a means to segment recipients. With this feature, you can define tags and send or receive messages by tags. A message is targeted to only the devices that are subscribed to a tag.

### Broadcast notifications
{: #broadcast-notifications-overview}

Broadcast notifications are a form of tag push notifications that are targeted to all subscribed devices, and are enabled by default for any push-enabled {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirst_notm}} application by a subscription to a reserved `Push.all` tag (auto-created for every device). Broadcast notifications can be disabled by unsubscribing from the reserved `Push.all` tag.

### Unicast notifications
{: #unicast-notifications-overview}

Unicast notifications, or User Authenticated Notifications are secured with OAuth. These notification messages are targeted to a particular device or a userID(s). The userID in the user subscription can come from the underlying security context.

### Interactive notifications
{: #interactive-notifications-overview}

With interactive notification, when a notification arrives, users can act without opening the application. When an interactive notification arrives, the device shows action buttons along with the notification message. Currently, interactive notifications are supported on devices with iOS version 8 onwards. If an interactive notification is sent to an iOS device with version earlier than 8, the notification actions are not displayed.

Learn how to handle [Interactive notifications](/docs/mobilefoundation-sw?topic=mobilefoundation-sw-interactive_notifications#interactive_notifications).

### Silent notifications
{: #silent-notifications-overview}

Silent notifications are notifications that do not display alerts or otherwise disturb the user. When a silent notification arrives, the application handing code runs in background without bringing the application to foreground. Currently, the silent notifications are supported on iOS devices with version 7 onwards. If the silent notification is sent to iOS devices with version lesser than 7, the notification is ignored if the application is running in background. If the application is running in the foreground, then the notification callback method is invoked.

Learn how to handle [Silent notifications](/docs/mobilefoundation-sw?topic=mobilefoundation-sw-silent_notifications#silent_notifications).

Unicast notifications do not contain any tag in the payload. The notification message can target multiple devices or users by specifying multiple deviceIDs or userIDs, in the target block of the POST message API.
{: note}

## Proxy settings
{: #proxy-settings}

Use the proxy settings to set the optional proxy through which notifications are sent to APNS and FCM. You can set the proxy by using the ** push.apns.proxy.* ** and ** push.gcm.proxy.* ** configuration properties. For more information, see [List of JNDI properties for {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_short_notm}} push service](http://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/installation-configuration/production/server-configuration/#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-push-service).

WNS does not have proxy support.
{: note}

### Using WebSphere DataPower as a push notification endpoint
{: #proxy-settings-datapower-endpoint}

You can set up DataPower to accept notification requests from {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_short_notm}} and redirect it to FCM and WNS.

APNs is not supported.
{: note}

#### Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_short_notm}}
{: #proxy-settings-config-mfp-server}

In `server.xml`, configure the following JNDI property.

```xml
<jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.dp.endpoint" value = '"https://host"' />
<jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.dp.gcm.port" value = '"port"' />
<jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.dp.wns.port" value = '"port"' />
```
{: codeblock}

Where `host` is the hostname of DataPower and `port` is the port number on which [HTTPS](#x2193603){: term} Front Side Handler is configured for FCM and WNS.
