# Capture and send in-app user feedback
{: #sending_in_app_user_feedback_ios}

In-App User Feedback deepens your application performance analysis. You can enable your application users and testers to provide rich contextual feedback to the app owners. App owners get real-time feedback from its users on the application usage experience, which App owners and Developers can further act on. This feature brings in significant agility to application up-keep. Use the following API to switch your application to Interactive Feedback Mode in any action handler in your application, for example, when you handle the click of a button or the selection of a menu item.

To enable your iOS app to send in-app user feedback, perform the following steps.

1. Add the following to your applicationâ€™s podfile.

   ```bash
   pod 'IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationAnalytics'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Ensure you update your pod by running the following command from the root of your Xcode project.

   ```bash
   pod update
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Call the following API in the action handler of your application.

   ```swift
   WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().triggerFeedbackMode();
   ```
   {: codeblock}
