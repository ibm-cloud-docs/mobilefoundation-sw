### Configuring the MF Java&trade; adapter
{: #configuring-the-mf-java-adapter}

To connect to your Cloud Object Storage instance, some details of your Cloud Object Storage instance need to be provided in the `adapter.xml` file. Furnish values for the following fields:

1. **endpointURL**: This field is the public endpoint url for your Cloud Object Storage object. This URL can be found on your Cloud Object Storage's dashboard, under **Buckets (on the menu options) -> <your-bucket-name> (`sharedgallery` in this sample) -> Configuration -> Endpoints -> Public**
1. **AuthToken**: In this tutorial, [IAM](#x2193801){: term} [authentication](#x2014567){: term} is used.

For the Java&trade; adapter to connect to your instance of Cloud Object Storage, authentication that uses IAM or HMAC is needed. Following are the steps to get the IAM token. For further details on IAM and HMAC authentication processes, click [here](/docs/cloud-object-storage/api-reference?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api-bucket-operations).

#### Obtaining IAM OAuth token by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
{: #obtaining-iam-oath-token-using-ibm-cloud-cli}

1. First, make sure that you have an API key. Get the API key from [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/#/users).
1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform by using the CLI.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud login --apikey <value>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Your output is similar to the following snippet,

   ```text
   Authenticating...
   OK

   Targeted account <account-name> (<account-id>)

   Targeted resource group default

   API endpoint:     https://api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com (API version: 	2.128.0)
   Region:           us-south
   User:             <email-address>
   Account:          <account-name> (<account-id>)
   Resource group:   default
   ```
   {: screeen}

1. To get all the service instances on your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, run the following command on the CLI.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud resource service-instances
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Expected output:

   ```text
   Retrieving service instances in resource group Default and all 	locations under account <account-name> as <email-address>...
   OK
   Name                                               Location     	State    Type               Tags
   <resource-instance-name>                           global       	active   service_instance
   ```
   {: screeen}

1. Run the following command to get the details of your Cloud Object Storage instance. `<instance-name>` is the name of your Cloud Object Storage service (`newObject` for this tutorial).

   ```bash
   ibmcloud resource service-instance <instance-name>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Expected output:

   ```text
   Retrieving service instance <sinstance-name> in resource group 	Default under account <account-name> as<email-address>...
   OK

   Name:                  <resource-instance-name>
   ID:                    <resource-instance-id>
   Location:                 global
   Service Name:          cloud-object-storage
   Resource Group Name:   Default
   State:                 active
   Type:                  service_instance
   Tags:
   ```
   {: screeen}

1. To get IAM token, run the following command:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Expected output:

   ```text
   IAM token:  Bearer <token>
   UAA token:  Bearer <refresh-token>
   ```
   {: screeen}

After you add the *endpointURL* and the *authToken* values, build the adapter. Go to the adapter's root folder in the command prompt and run.

```bash
mfpdev adapter build
```
{: codeblock}

The `*.adapter` file is created in the `target` folder. Run the following command:

```bash
mfpdev adapter deploy
```
{: codeblock}

The adapter is deployed to the MF instance.

Alternatively, the adapter can be deployed on the MF server dashboard. Open the MF server dashboard, on the menu, click **Adapters -> New** to open the page as shown in the following image.

![MFPNewAdapterRegister](images/mfp_new_adapter_register.png)

Then, click **Deploy Adapter** and upload the `.adapter` file from the **target** folder.

### Configuring the Ionic App
{: #configuring-the-ionic-app}

In the app, do the following steps:

1. Go to the folder that contains the Ionic application.
1. Add the cordova MF plug-in

   ```bash
   ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp
   ```

1. Add the android or iOS platform

   ```bash
   ionic cordova platform add android
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   ionic cordova platform add ios
   ```

1. Register your app to the MF server by running

   ```bash
   mfpdev app register
   ```

   Alternatively, the app can be registered on the MF server [dashboard](#x2363941){: term}. Open the MF server dashboard and on the menu click **Applications -> New**.

   The page as shown in the following image gets loaded.

   ![MFPNewAppRegister](images/mfp_new_app_register.png)

   Enter the details requested. Give a name for your application in the textbox 'Application Name'. Choose the required platform.

   For Android, the **Package** textbox accepts the *Application identifier*. This parameter can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` as package of your Android application. The **Version** textbox field must be filled with the *versionName* value from the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

   For iOS, the **Bundle ID** textbox accepts *Application identifier* (case-sensitive). This parameter can be found in the `mfpclient.plist` of your iOS application. The **Version** textbox field must be filled with the *version* value from the `mfpclient.plist` file in your iOS application.

1. Run `ionic cordova prepare` for changes to percolate to the environments added.
1. Run

   ```bash
   ionic cordova build android
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   ionic cordova build ios
   ```
   to ensure that the typescript changes are added to the environments.

1. Attach device or run an emulator or simulator and run the following command.

   ```bash
   ionic cordova run android
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   ionic cordova run ios
   ```

### Navigating the Ionic application
{: #navigating-the-ionic-application}

The Ionic application displays a list of short stories that were uploaded previously (as the last step in the section [Cloud Object Storage Setup](#cloud-object-storage-setup)), from your created Cloud Object Storage instance. On selecting a particular story option, the selected story is loaded and displayed. An option to add a story is also provided which is then uploaded to the Cloud Object Storage instance.

The initial Cloud Object Storage objects list looks like the following image.

![Cloud Object Storage before](images/cos_before.png)

The home page of the application provides an option to either *Get all stories* or *Add story*

![App home screen](images/app-home-screen.png)

On clicking **Get all stories**, the stories available on Cloud Object Storage are displayed.

![Apps select story](images/app-select-story.png)

Select a story to be loaded from the drop-down menu and click **Load**

![App story loaded](images/app-story-loaded.png)

Next, click **Add story** to add a story of your own. Enter a title for the story and the story's content in the text area and click **Add**.

![App adds input](images/app-add-input.png)

When the story is added, a message of successful addition of the story is displayed.

![App story added](images/app-story-added.png)

The Cloud Object Storage dashboard now has the story is added from the application as well.

![Cloud Object Storage added](images/cos_added.png)

The IAM OAuth token that is obtained by using `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens` has an expiration time and the adapter fails with an exception of `403 - Forbidden`. It must be hence ensured that the token is valid on the deployed adapter for the app to function as expected.
