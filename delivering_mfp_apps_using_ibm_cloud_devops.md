# Delivering {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} apps by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.jazzhub_short}}
{: #delivering_mobile_foundation_apps_using_ibm_cloud_devops_services}

This tutorial helps you to automate the delivery of apps and adapters to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short }} by using the {{site.data.keyword.jazzhub_title}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The following image provides an overview of the pipeline.

![overview_of_pipeline](images/p00_overview_of_pipeline.png "Six stages of the DevOps pipeline")

## Prerequisites
{: #mpfapps-devops-prerequisites }

* [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) Account
* [mfpdev-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mfpdev-cli){: external}
* A sample App and [MFP adapter](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/){: external}
* [GitHub](http://github.com/){: external} Account
* *Optional:* [Bitbar](https://bitbar.com/testing/){: external} instance and Bitbar API Key (You can use of any service according to your requirements).

## Creating Continuous Delivery Service and Toolchain
{: #creating-continuous-delivery-service-and-toolchain }

* Search for "Continuous Delivery" the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog (or [click here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery)).
* Create the service by providing service name, region, and so on.
   In the following example, the service name as `MFP App/Adapter delivery Test`, region or location as *London* and resource group as *Default* is used.

   ![configuring_continuous_delivery_service](images/p01_configuring_continuous_delivery_service.png "Catalog create page for {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} service instance")

* From the Navigation menu, select **DevOps**, then click **Create a toolchain**, and search for “Build your own toolchain” to create a toolchain from scratch.

   ![search_build_your_own_toolchain](images/p02_search_build_your_own_toolchain.png "Create your own toolchain page with search result for build your own toolchain")

* Provide the toolchain name, region, and so on, to configure.

## Integrating GitHub with the toolchain for version control and pipeline trigger
{: #integrating-github-with-the-toolchain}

* From the **Overview** page in the navigation, click **Add a Tool** and search for GitHub.
* Configure GitHub tool for **GitHub server address**, **repository type**, and **repository URL**.
* You can create a new repository, fork, clone or use an existing repository.

   In the following example, GitHub server as "[https://github.com](http://github.com/){: external}", repository type as *Existing* and Repository [URL](#x2042718){: term} as *https:// github .com/sagar20896/mfp-devops-20181210030116092* is used.

   ![configuring_toolchain](images/p03_configuring_toolchain.png "Configure the Integration screen with GitHub server, Repository type, and Repository URL fields")

### Adding the delivery pipeline to the toolchain
{: #adding-the-delivery-pipeline-to-the-toolchain}

Use **Add Tool** and search for *Delivery Pipeline*. Configure pipeline and click **Create integration**.

### Adding stages to the pipeline
{: #adding-stages-to-the-pipeline}

#### Stage 1 - Setting up {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}
{: #stage1-setting-up-mobile-foundation}

In this stage, you would be spinning up an instance of {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}. Adding GitHub to the pipeline would be in this stage and it triggers the pipeline whenever a change is pushed to the Git repository. Following steps show the GitHub configuration. You can set the stage [trigger](#x2005384){: term} based on your requirement. It might be manual or automatic.

In the following example, Input Type as *Git repository*, Git repository as *mfp-devops-20181210030116092* and Git URL as `https://github.com/sagar20896/mfp-devops-20181210030116092` and branch as *master* is set.

![first_stage_git_input](images/p4_first_stage_git_input.png "Set up Mobile Foundation screen with the Input tab selected")

- Click **Add stage** and configure the **Input** tab to point to the GitHub repo as shown in the image.
- In the **Jobs** tab, click **ADD JOB** and select *Deploy* as job type. Select **Deployer type** as *Cloud Foundry*.
- If you do not have an API key, you can create one for your {{ site.data.keyword.cloud_notm }} account [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/#/apikeys).

Select/fill the other fields as required. Add the following lines in the **Deploy script**:

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	token=$(cf oauth-token | awk '{print $2}')
	json={\"deploy\":\"true\",\"name\":\"$INSTANCE_NAME\",\"token\":\"$token\"}
	echo "Input: $json"
	cf cs "Mobile Foundation" Developer $INSTANCE_NAME -c $json
	echo "Created Service Instance"
	sleep 1m
	cf create-service-key $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1
	echo "Created Service Keys"
	credentials=$(cf service-key $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1)
	echo "Credentials: $credentials"
	password=$(echo $credentials | grep \"password\": | awk -F "\"password\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	echo "Password: $password"
	url=$(echo $credentials | grep \"url\": | awk -F "\"url\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	echo "URL: $url"
	user=$(echo $credentials | grep \"user\": | awk -F "\"user\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | awk -F \  '{print $1 }'| sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	echo "User: $user"
	until $(curl --output /dev/null --silent --head --fail $url/mfpconsole); do
	printf '.'
	sleep 5
	done
	# Deploying the confidential client
	curl -u $user:$password -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"clients":[{"id":"test","displayName":"Test","secret":"test","allowedScope":"*"},{"id": "admin","displayName": "admin","secret": "darwIn$hfr","allowedScope": "push.* mfp.admin.plugins settings.read"},{"id": "push","displayName": "push","secret": "darwIn$hfr","allowedScope": "authorization.introspect"}]}' $url/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/confidentialclients
	exit
```
{: codeblock}

In the preceding script, you can use Cloud Foundry [CLI](#x2008863){: term} to create a {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} service instance.

![stage1_jobs_tab_config](images/p05_stage1_jobs_tab_config.png "Set up Mobile Foundation screen with the Jobs tab selected")

In the **Environment properties** tab, Add property *INSTANCE\_NAME* (as text property) as what you want the Mobile Foundation instance name to be. It would be used as an identifier across many stages.

![stage1_environment_properties](images/p06_stage1_environment_properties.png "Set up Mobile Foundation screen with the Environment properties tab selected")

#### Stage 2 - Building an adapter
{: #stage2-building-an-adapter}

In this stage, you pull the adapter source code and build it.

- Click **Add stage** and configure the stage based on your preferences for adding GitHub repository as input. The **Stage trigger** must be set to *Run jobs when the previous stage is completed*.
- Switch to the **Jobs** tab and add a build job. Select builder type as *Maven* and add the following lines in the build scripts.

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	# To use Node.js 6.7.0, uncomment the following line:
	export PATH=/opt/IBM/node-v6.7.0/bin:$PATH
	echo "#### npm install -g mfpdev-cli"
	npm install -g mfpdev-cli
	echo "#### mfpdev --version"
	mfpdev --version
	echo "#### cd adapters/JavaAdapter"
	cd adapters/JavaAdapter
	echo "#### Build the adapter : mfpdev adapter build"
	mfpdev adapter build
```
{: codeblock}

In the preceding script, you install [mfpdev-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mfpdev-cli){: external} to build adapters by using adapter command in your repository's `adapters/JavaAdapter`.

In the following example, you use **Builder type** as *npm* and use the script that is provided in the build script. You leave **Working directory** and **Build archive directory** parameters empty.

![build_adapter_stage_jobs_config](images/p07_build_adapter_stage_jobs_config.png "BuildAdapter screen with the Jobs tab selected")

#### Stage 3 - Deploying an adapter
{: #stage3-deploying-an-adapter}

In this stage, you deploy the adapter to the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} instance that you created in the first stage.

- Add a stage.
- Configure the input.
- Set the input type to **Build Artifacts**, **Stage** as the stage name where adapter is built, and the job that builds the adapter in the build adapter stage.
- The **Stage trigger** must be set to *Run jobs when the previous stage is completed*.
- Add a **Deploy** job from the **Jobs** tab.
- Select **Deployer type** as *Cloud Foundry* and configure the rest based on your preferences.

In the following example, you use **Deployer type** as *Cloud Foundry*, **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Region** as *Dallas*, API key as the same that you created in the first stage.

![deploy_adapter](images/p08_deploy_adapter.png "Deploy screen with the Jobs tab selected")

Use the following **Deploy script**:

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	set -x
	# To use Node.js 6.7.0, uncomment the following line:
	export PATH=/opt/IBM/node-v6.7.0/bin:$PATH

	echo "Getting server and credentials"
	# get mfpserver url, username and password

	      credentials=$(cf service-key $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1)
	 echo "Credentials: $credentials"
	 password=$(echo $credentials | grep \"password\": | awk -F "\"password\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "Password: $password"
	 url=$(echo $credentials | grep \"url\": | awk -F "\"url\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/' | sed -e 's/https/http/g')
	 echo "URL: $url"
	 user=$(echo $credentials | grep \"user\": | awk -F "\"user\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | awk -F \  '{print $1 }'| sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "User: $user"

	url=$url:80
	echo "#### npm install -g mfpdev-cli"
	npm install -g mfpdev-cli
	echo "#### mfpdev --version"
	mfpdev --version
	echo "#### cd adapters/JavaAdapter"
	cd adapters/JavaAdapter
	echo "#### adding server definition"
	mfpdev server add server1 --url $url --login $user --password $password --setdefault
	echo "#### Deploy Adapter : mfpdev adapter deploy"
	mfpdev adapter deploy
```
{: codeblock}

The script uses mfpdev-cli's adapter deploy command to deploy adapter to the MFP instance.

- Set *INSTANCE_NAME* in the **Environment properties** tab with the value same as the one set in first stage when {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} instance was created. You use the same instance name so that the adapter gets deployed to the instance you created in the first stage.

#### Stage 4 - Test adapter
{: #stage4-test-adapter}

In this stage, you intend to test the adapter that were built and deployed in the previous stages. In the sample adapter repository, you have scripts at `adapters/JavaAdapter/tests` to test the adapter end points.

- Set the **Input** as *GitHub repository* same as the configurations of build adapters.
- Add *deploy job* in the **Jobs** tab. Select the **Deployer type** as *Cloud Foundry*. You use deploy job instead of test job because deploy has options to integrate with cloud foundry easily.

Use the following scripts for testing adapters.

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	set -x
	# To use Node.js 6.7.0, uncomment the following line:
	export PATH=/opt/IBM/node-v6.7.0/bin:$PATH

	echo "Getting server and credentials"
	# get mfpserver url, username and password

	 credentials=$(cf service-key $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1)
	 echo "Credentials: $credentials"
	 password=$(echo $credentials | grep \"password\": | awk -F "\"password\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "Password: $password"
	 url=$(echo $credentials | grep \"url\": | awk -F "\"url\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/' | sed -e 's/https/http/g')
	 echo "URL: $url"
	 user=$(echo $credentials | grep \"user\": | awk -F "\"user\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | awk -F \  '{print $1 }'| sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "User: $user"

	url=$url:80
	echo "#### npm install -g mfpdev-cli"
	npm install -g mfpdev-cli
	echo "#### mfpdev --version"
	mfpdev --version
	echo "#### adding server definition"
	mfpdev server add server1 --url $url --login $user --password $password --setdefault

	# Make sure to have the test confidential client. Try another attempt to deploy test confidential client
	curl -u $user:$password -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"clients":[{"id":"test","displayName":"Test","secret":"test","allowedScope":"*"},{"id": "admin","displayName": "admin","secret": "darwIn$hfr","allowedScope": "push.* mfp.admin.plugins settings.read"},{"id": "push","displayName": "push","secret": "darwIn$hfr","allowedScope": "authorization.introspect"}]}' $url/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/confidentialclients

	echo "#### cd adapters/JavaAdapter/tests"
	cd adapters/JavaAdapter/tests
	echo "#### Testing Adapter Endpoints"
	./resource.sh
	./resource_greet.sh
	./resource_protected.sh
	./resource_testpost.sh
```
{: codeblock}

- Add *INSTANCE_NAME* in environment properties, same values that you add in previous stages.

You can use API testing [framework](#x2023472){: term} for testing the adapters. In this example, you have shell scripts that call the adapter and test for correctness.

#### Stage 5 - Building apps with Fastlane
{: #stage5-building-apps-with-fastlane}

Input for this stage should be the GitHub repo that you used in the previous stages. This stage must get triggered after the previous stage (Test adapter) passes.

For building the app you use deploy job [template](#x2041200){: term} in the **Jobs** tab. Use *Cloud Foundry* as **Deployer type**.

Use the following script to build the app:

```bash
	# To use Node.js 6.7.0, uncomment the following line:
	export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

	export PATH=/opt/IBM/node-v6.7.0/bin:$PATH

	echo "Getting server and credentials"
	# get mfpserver url, username and password

	 credentials=$(cf service-key $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1)
	 echo "Credentials: $credentials"
	 password=$(echo $credentials | grep \"password\": | awk -F "\"password\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "Password: $password"
	 url=$(echo $credentials | grep \"url\": | awk -F "\"url\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/' | sed -e 's/https/http/g')
	 echo "URL: $url"
	 user=$(echo $credentials | grep \"user\": | awk -F "\"user\": " '{print $2 }' | awk -F , '{print $1 }' | awk -F \  '{print $1 }'| sed 's/.\(.*\)/\1/' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/')
	 echo "User: $user"

	url=$url:80
	echo "#### npm install -g mfpdev-cli"
	npm install -g mfpdev-cli
	echo "#### mfpdev --version"
	mfpdev --version
	echo "#### cd apps/ResourceRequestAndroid"
	cd apps/ResourceRequestAndroid
	#echo "#### adding server definition"
	mfpdev server add server1 --url $url --login $user --password $password --setdefault
	echo "#### Register App with MFP Server : mfpdev app register"
	mfpdev app register


	export JAVA_HOME=/opt/IBM/java8
	cd /home/pipeline

```
{: codeblock}

In the preceding script, you use `mfpdev-cli` to register the app to {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}
 [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/){: external} to build and release the app.

The environment variables that are used in the script is defined in the next **Environment properties** tab.

In the environment properties, add the following properties:
- *INSTANCE_NAME* as the **mfp instance name**
- *appPublishUrl* as **Repository** where the app is required to be published so that the testing stage can pull it.
- *gitPushUser* as the **GitHub username**
- *gitPushEmail* as the **GitHub user’s email**
- *gitPushToken* as the **git push token**
- *apkGitPushUrl* as **https://$gitPushToken:x-oauth-basic@github.com/<path><SPACE><branch>**
    `eg.: https://$gitPushToken:x-oauth-basic@github.com/ShinojEdakkara/mfp-apps master`

#### Stage 6 - Test the app by using Bitbar
{: #stage6-test-the-app-using-bitbar}

This stage also is open ended. You can use any testing framework based on your requirements. In this example, you use [Bitbar](https://bitbar.com/testing/){: external}.

- Add the GitHub repository details about the test project you have (this project would consist of all the test scripts and artifacts that are used to support the testing).
- For Bitbar, add a build job under **Jobs** tab and select the **Builder type** as *Maven*.

Use a build script similar to the following script,

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	cd /home/pipeline/$BUILD_ID/appium/sample-scripts/java
	mvn clean install -X -Dtest=$test -DexecutionType=$executionType -DapiKey=$bitbarApiKey -DapplicationPath=$applicationPath -Dtestdroid_project=$testdroid_project
```
{: codeblock}

For the preceding script, you would require a few environment variables.

- *screenshot\_dir* as **/home/pipeline/home/pipeline/$BUILD\_ID/target**
- *applicationPath* as the **GitHub path** to the application you intend to test
- *executionType* as the **Execution type**
- *test* as the **Test** you want to perform
- *bitbarApiKey* as the **Bitbar API Key**
- *testdroid_project* as the **Project**.

#### Stage 7 - Tearing down {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}
{: #stage7-tearing-down-mobile-foundation}

In this stage you would be tearing down the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} instance that was created in the first stage for build, deploy, and testing in the previous stages.

There wouldn't be any input to this stage.

- Create a *Deploy job* in the **Jobs** tab.
- Use the following script,

```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	sleep 60
	cf dsk -f $INSTANCE_NAME-Analytics Credentials-1
	cf ds -f $INSTANCE_NAME-Analytics
	cf dsk -f $INSTANCE_NAME Credentials-1
	cf ds -f $INSTANCE_NAME
	cf d -f $INSTANCE_NAME-Server
	exit
```
{: codeblock}

- Set *INSTANCE_NAME* in the **Environment properties** tab as the one set in first stage when {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} instance was created.

You can automatically create a toolchain with sample code that is mentioned in this page. Refer to [readme file](https://github.com/ShinojEdakkara/mfp-toolchain){: external}, and follow the instructions.
