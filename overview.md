## Key capabilities offered by {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}}

### User Engagement
{: #user_engagement}

Building engaging mobile apps is the key to the success of an app strategy for any business. User engagement can be built into apps by using push notifications. {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} supports sending notifications to iOS, Android, and Windows&trade; 10 devices. Notifications can be sent to all users, a subset of users or to users based on their area of interest. Interactive and silent notifications are supported for relevant platforms. Personalization is a key aspect for user engagement. You can segment the users and tailor apps for specific user segments with the **Live Update** capability.

###  App Insights
{: #app_insights}

To keep your user engagement relevant and active you must obtain insights into how your application is performing with users. The {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} feature of {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} provides this capability with in-built visualizations (charts and tables). With minimal instrumentation of your application, you can readily visualize, on the Mobile Analytics console the following actionable insights,
- **User Onboarding Patterns**: Do you have new users onboarding? Do you have existing users who return to your application?
- **Usage Patterns**: At what times is your application most and least used, is it meeting its business relevance in this regard?
- **Backend Performance**: What are the most used functions of your backend systems and what is their response time and stability, is there a need to rebalance your backend?
- **Application Stability**: How stable is your application over time and if there were crashes what are the causes (crash logs). Does your application design / implementation need fixing?
- **In-App User Experience**: What is the actual interactive experience that your users are undergoing while they use the app and how do they feel, do you need to revisit your user-study?
- **Custom Trails**: Custom charts, which are defined and plotted around custom data that is logged as part of application-specific trails and flows, also provides the flexibility to extend and define your own insights that can help your business decisions.

###  Security Framework
{: #security_framework}

Extensive mobile channel-specific security. Protect data on the device, APIs, and your brand from hackers and vulnerabilities. Offline data encryption, prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, deny access to lost or stolen devices, set up extra security for privileged operations, integrate with existing identity management solutions, protect from reverse engineering app code, and much more.

###  Business Logic
{: #business_logic}

Develop and run server-side code to connect to your backend systems. Build business logic as microservices that use Liberty, NodeJS, or Swift runtimes. Access the microservices by importing its swagger definition.

###  App Management
{:  #app_management}

Manage application versions and block outdated application versions. Skip app store approval and change your web resources directly.

###  Cognitive APIs
{:  #cognitive_apis}

Build smart apps by using Watson APIs (*Tone Analyzer, Language Translator, Discovery, or Conversation*) in your mobile apps. This integration helps use the mobile channel security and obtain insights on the APIs.
